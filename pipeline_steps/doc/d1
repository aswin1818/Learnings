OLTP System (Postgres):
This is where your transactional data resides. It contains information about sales, products, customers, and stores.

Data Lake (S3): S3 serves as a highly scalable and durable storage solution for your raw data. You can store data from various sources here, including your OLTP system, as well as any other relevant data sources.

ETL Tool (AWS Glue): Glue can be used to extract data from your OLTP system, transform it as needed (e.g., handling SCD Type 2 and Type 3 changes), and load it into your data warehouse. Glue can also be used to orchestrate and schedule your ETL jobs.

Data Warehouse (Redshift): Redshift is optimized for OLAP workloads and provides fast query performance for analytical queries. You can use Redshift to store your transformed data in a schema that's optimized for analytics, making it easy to query and analyze using BI tools or SQL queries.

SCD Type 2 and Type 3: By implementing SCD Type 2 and Type 3 in your ETL process, you're effectively managing changes to dimensional data over time. SCD Type 2 tracks historical changes by creating new records for each change, while SCD Type 3 maintains both current and previous values in the same record, allowing for easier querying of historical data.

Overall, this architecture should provide a scalable, performant, and flexible solution for building an OLAP system on AWS using Redshift, S3, Glue, and incorporating SCD Type 2 and Type 3 for managing slowly changing dimensions. Make sure to properly design your data models, ETL processes, and queries to ensure optimal performance and usability for your analytics needs.
